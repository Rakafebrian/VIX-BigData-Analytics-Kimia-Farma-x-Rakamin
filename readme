## 🧩 Project Overview

This project is part of the **Big Data Analytics – Kimia Farma x Rakamin Academy** program.  
It aims to analyze the **business performance of PT Kimia Farma (Persero) Tbk** during the period **2020–2023** using **Google BigQuery** and **Looker Studio**.  

Through this analysis, I explored sales trends, branch performance, product contributions, and customer satisfaction to generate actionable business insights.

## 🏢 About the Company

**Kimia Farma** is Indonesia's first pharmaceutical company, established in 1817 under the name *NV Chemicalien Handle Rathkamp & Co*.  
After Indonesia's independence, the government merged several pharmaceutical companies into **PNF Bhinneka Kimia Farma** (1958), and later in 1971, it became **PT Kimia Farma (Persero) Tbk**.  

The company continues to play a vital role in the Indonesian healthcare and pharmaceutical industry.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Evaluate Kimia Farma's **sales performance** from 2020–2023
2. Identify **trends, patterns, and insights** in business operations
3. Build a **BigQuery-based analysis table** by combining multiple datasets
4. Visualize business metrics through a **Looker Studio Performance Dashboard**

---

## 🚀 Missions

| Mission | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Mission 1** | Import dataset into **Google BigQuery** |
| **Mission 2** | Build an integrated **analysis table** using SQL JOIN |
| **Mission 3** | Create **Performance Dashboard** in **Looker Studio** |

---

## 🧱 Dataset Preparation

Steps to prepare and load the dataset:

1. Create a GCP project: `Rakamin_KF_Analytics`
2. Open **BigQuery Console**
3. Create a dataset: `kimia_farma`
4. Import all CSV data files
5. Verify import results and perform validation

---

## 🧮 SQL Data Modeling

An **analysis table** was created by joining four core tables:

- `kf_final_transaction`
- `kf_kantor_cabang`
- `kf_product`
- `kf_inventory`

The query combines transactional, product, branch, and inventory data — forming a unified dataset ready for analysis.

### Key Transformations:

- Categorizing product prices into ranges
- Calculating gross profit percentage
- Computing net sales (after discount)
- Deriving net profit (based on profit percentage)

**Type of Join:** LEFT JOIN — ensuring all transaction data remains intact even if related data is missing.

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted using SQL queries to summarize sales performance per branch.

**Metrics Calculated:**

- Total transactions
- Sales period
- Average price, discount, and profit %
- Total net sales & total profit
- Average rating (transaction & branch)
- Unique customers per branch

---

| **Average Discount** | 7.5% | Effective, non-aggressive promo |
| **Gross Profit %** | 25.6% | Stable and efficient pricing |
| **Revenue per Branch** | Rp 425–438B | Consistent sales performance |
| **Total Profit** | Rp 107–110B | Efficient cost control |
| **Avg. Transaction Rating** | 4.2 / 5 | Positive customer satisfaction |
| **Avg. Branch Rating** | 4.4 / 5 | Trusted and consistent service |
| **Unique Customers** | 17K–18.5K | Loyal customer base |
